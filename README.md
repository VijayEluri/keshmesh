Keshmesh
========

Keshmesh is an interactive tool for detecting and fixing concurrency bugs in Java programs. Keshmesh looks for certain bug patterns that are common in concurrent Java programs and offers automated fixes for some of the bug patterns. 

Keshmesh uses [WALA](http://wala.sf.net) to analyze programs for complex concurrency bug patterns that span multiple methods and involve aliases. Keshmesh uses [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sf.net) to report bugs and offer automated fixes to the users of [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org).

Keshmesh has been developed at the [University of Illinois](http://illinois.edu/) and is licensed under the Illinois/NCSA Open Source License. See [LICENSE.TXT](https://github.com/reprogrammer/keshmesh/raw/master/LICENSE.TXT) for more details.
